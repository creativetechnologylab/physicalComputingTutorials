## What is Automator?
Apple’s Automator is a built-in Mac feature that allows users to easily “program” their Macs to automatically execute certain repetitive tasks, thus saving time by removing the need to perform said tasks manually.

Automator can be helpful when you don't have much programming knowledge or don't want to do a lot of coding. One of the most common usage is Auto-printing. Unfortunately, the app is not available for other operating systems.

### 1. Launch Automator
Search for "Automator" in Spotlight and launch.

Now that you have set up a auto-print workflow, it can be a great add-on for your project. For example, we have a generative graphic sketch in Processing, we program it to save the graphics every 1 minute in a designated folder and the Automator will print it auotmatically through a thermal printer.
